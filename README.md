# Personal Portfolio Website (https://jonves-dev.vercel.app/)

## Objective

The goal of this project was to design and build a clean, modern personal portfolio website to showcase my background, skills, and projects in a clear and professional way. The site serves as a central hub for my online presence, allowing visitors to quickly learn about my interests and education, review my technical skill set, explore selected projects, and get in touch with me.

The portfolio was built using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, with an emphasis on responsiveness, accessibility, and maintainable component-based design.

### Contact Me Section

This ensures multiple reliable communication options while keeping the implementation simple.
